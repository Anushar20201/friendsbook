# FRIENDSBOOK

### Description

FRIENDSBOOK is a social network application that uses a NoSQL database - MongoDB
SO THAT your website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. 
Using this application, we can perform CRUD operations on a user and his thoughts. 
In addition to this, we can tag friends to a user and also monitor reactions of thoughts.
I have used use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js (Links to an external site.) and Mongoose (Links to an external site.) packages, I have used a JavaScript date library  to format timestamps.


### Use cases

- GIVEN a social network API
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
